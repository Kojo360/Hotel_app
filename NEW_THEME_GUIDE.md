## 🖼️ Logo Watermark Background

**Your logo now appears as a subtle watermark across the entire page!**

### How it works:
- The logo displays as a **large, faded watermark** in the center of every page
- Set to **3% opacity** so it's visible but doesn't interfere with content
- **Fixed position** - stays in place as users scroll
- **Responsive** - automatically adjusts to different screen sizes
- **Non-intrusive** - users can click through it (pointer-events: none)

### Requirements:
Your logo file must be at: `static/images/logo.png`

If your logo is named differently or is a different format:
1. Open `templates/base.html`
2. Find line ~34: `background-image: url('/static/images/logo.png');`
3. Change `logo.png` to your filename (e.g., `logo.jpg`, `logo.svg`)
