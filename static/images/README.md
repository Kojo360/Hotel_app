# Logo Upload Instructions

## How to Add Your Hotel Logo

1. **Prepare your logo file:**
   - File name: `logo.png` (or `logo.jpg`, `logo.svg`)
   - Recommended size: 150px height for best display
   - Transparent background (PNG) works best

2. **Upload the logo:**
   - Place your logo file directly in this folder: `d:\hotel_app\static\images\`
   - The file should be named: `logo.png` (or update the extension in base.html)

3. **After uploading:**
   - No server restart needed! Just refresh your browser
   - The logo will appear in the navigation bar on all pages
   - All users (local and remote) will see the logo automatically

## File Location
Current directory: `static/images/`

The static files are served at: `/static/images/logo.png`
